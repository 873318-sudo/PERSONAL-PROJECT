    <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
    <p>
        Now, you might be wondering: what did I gain from this website?<br><br><br>

        If that website was so brief in terms of the information, what’s the point?<br><br><br>

        Here’s the thing:<br><br><br>

        This website taught you how to think like a sprinter for yourself more than anything.<br><br><br>

        I left gaps in the websites on purpose so you can try and see if you can research, or figure it out and connect the dots yourself.<br><br><br>

        Anything new you add to your training plan, you know WHY you added it, not just because “some sprinter said so”.<br><br><br>

        And knowing that?<br><br><br>

        That’s how you get ahead and do every rep with quality.<br><br><br>

        I could’ve made this website astronomically longer in terms of what I talk about (like the examples mentioned in the introduction).<br><br><br>

        But it wouldn’t feel like you’re learning about sprinting anymore and it’s just a physics or biology lesson that no athlete would want to read.<br><br><br>

        You’ve officially made it to the end of the website, and now know how to think like a true elite sprinter.<br><br><br>

        <strong>Now go hit that track with full intention.</strong>
