    <h2>1.1: Reassurance</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Let me get something straight with you as a mindset shift before I start teaching you how to execute a block start effectively,</strong><br><br><br>

        this is something to keep in mind for the <strong>rest of the website.</strong><br><br><br>

        The blocks are <strong>important,</strong> but it’s not everything⁽¹⁾.<br><br><br>

        The same goes for anything else in the 100m, top speed, top speed maintenance/endurance, your late acceleration, <strong>whatever,</strong><br><br><br>

        that’s because every part (or phase) in the 100m is <strong>built off of the last one,</strong> they’re not entirely different things on their own.<br><br><br>

        For example, if top speed requires relaxation otherwise your form will get messed up, that doesn’t mean your start doesn’t need it,<br><br><br>

        it’s just more <strong>dominant</strong> in the top speed phase.<br><br><br>

        Meaning, just because you did some top speed training the other day, you can still get faster in the start phase indirectly.<br><br><br>

        <strong>Why?</strong><br><br><br>

        <strong>Because your neuromuscular efficiency improves.</strong><br><br><br>

        Simply, your nervous system’s (your brain being the center, which is why the name central nervous system comes up a lot) ability to effectively fire the right muscles,<br><br><br>

        so you can maximize your force application and basically optimize every metric in sprinting.<br><br><br>

        Say you’re trying to lift a heavy weight,<br><br><br>

        With high neuromuscular efficiency, your nervous system can fire the right muscles all at the same time and with the right effort, making it <strong>easier to execute said task</strong>⁽²⁾.<br><br><br>

        <strong>Sprinting is a highly mental game</strong>⁽³⁾, keeping this locked in is critical for quality sessions instead of going through the motions,<br><br><br>

        …and the best part?<br><br><br>

        <strong>It is highly trainable</strong>⁽⁴⁾.<br><br><br>

        <strong>truly unleashing your maximum potential.</strong><br><br><br>

        And remember, everything here is <strong>traditional,</strong> experimentation to find what works for YOU is HIGHLY recommended.<br><br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>1.2: Block start</h2>
    <p>
        The block start is actually simpler than some people make it seem.<br><br><br>

        If you know what a four or three-point start looks like (2 feet and both hands on floor is 4-point, 2 feet and 1 hand on floor is three-point),<br><br><br>

        it’s basically that, but with pads.<br><br><br>

        The block starts are super structured, even though they look complicated and everyone has their own way of doing them⁽⁵⁾.<br><br><br>

        BUT, it can be broken down into this order:
        <ul>
            <li>The set-up of the blocks</li>
            <li>“On your marks” position</li>
            <li>“Set” position</li> 
            <li>Push-off (when the gun fires)</li>
        </ul>

        Note that the block start is the most “tutorial” wise segment of the progression, as it is the most unique thing to sprinting,<br><br><br>

        but that doesn’t change the main purpose.<br><br><br>

        The set-up:
        You hear everyone say, 2 feet on the front, 3 on the back.<br><br><br>

        What does it actually look like?<br><br><br>

        From the starting line on the track, count 2 foot-lengths (heel touches the start line).<br><br><br>

        That’s where the front pad goes, at the end of your foot.<br><br><br>

        Then, count another foot-length from the front pad or just count three foot-lengths from the starting line.<br><br><br>

        That’s where the back pad goes.<br><br><br>

        Once you get more advanced, you can start using your fingers to get more precise measures once you find what’s best for you.<br><br><br>

        Whichever foot goes front or back depends on what you’re most comfortable with.<br><br><br>

        And if you wanna figure that out…<br><br><br>

        Stand straight, then fall forwards,<br><br><br>

        Whichever foot you catch yourself with is generally the foot that goes in front⁽⁶⁾.<br><br><br>

        “On your marks” position:
        Much simpler than the set-up of the blocks.<br><br><br>

        The action is you simply just get into the blocks.<br><br><br>

        Once you get into the blocks, this is what should be in your position:
        <ul>
            <li>Hands just behind the start line, around shoulder-width apart</li>
            <li>Hands are NOT flat</li>
            <li>Your shoulders should be perpendicular or leaning over your hands</li>
            <li>Knee of the back leg should be resting on the track</li>
            <li>Pushing into the pads</li>
            <li>Feel tension running from the arm through the shoulders</li>
        </ul>
        
        “Set” position:
        Now, this one matters slightly more than the “on your marks” position.<br><br><br>

        What should I do? Get up using your hips.<br><br><br>

        Here’s what should be there:
        <ul>
            <li>Still pushing into the pads</li>
            <li>Hips slightly higher than shoulders</li>
            <li>Weight must be forward</li>
            <li>Back leg roughly 120 degrees</li>
            <li>Front leg roughly 90 degrees</li>
        </ul>

        If that sounds difficult to coordinate or imagine, the mental cue<br><br><br>

        “You should feel ready to explode off at any moment.”<br><br><br>

        …gets your technique most of the way there.<br><br><br>

        The push-off:
        This is the moment you’re going to PUSH off your front foot as hard as you can.<br><br><br>

        The back foot?<br><br><br>

        Pull it to the front to take the next step as fast and as low as possible.<br><br><br>

        You should have:
        <ul>
            <li>Triple-extension (front leg extends fully)</li>
            <li>Body leaves track low, around 45 degrees in most cases</li>
            <li>Head and neck stay neutral and relaxed, not facing too down or too up</li>
            <li>The opposite of your front leg has your arm swinging forward aggressively</li>
            <li>Back foot snaps forward and stays low</li>
            <li>Shin angles at roughly the same angle as your body/torso</li>
        </ul>
    
        As another mental cue,<br><br><br>

        “You should feel like you’re trying to push the earth behind you, NOT just taking a step.”<br><br><br>

        What about the first step?<br><br><br>

        In the general sense:<br><br><br>

        You do the same thing as the push-off but your arms are slightly tighter because there's less ground to pull your back leg from step 1 to 2, compared to the push-off to step 1.<br><br><br>
